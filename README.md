This is a concept prototype designed to send HTTP get requests through the TOR network. In order to make the act of connecting to the server less suspicious for active users, the system coopts passive users through 2 methods: 1. Serving an advertisement through an iframe that connects passive users to the server, and 2. Hiding background scripts in a chrome extension that connects to the server every time a user opens a new tab or moves to a new link, thus perfectly imitating web-browser traffic. 
The files contain the concept chrome extension, the ad with embedded code along with an ad-server, a demo webpage with the ad, and the TOR server itself.
